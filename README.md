## Project

FooDog is a project talking about __dogs food__.  
The client already have a website, but want to increase his online presence through a blog.   
We have to adapt to a detailed graphic charter and develop a responsive website, ready to be frequently updated.

## Repo

We're dynamically assigning each other tasks, but we started by splitting between us the project.   
Everyone took a different page template and we regularly do small debriefings to keep the work consistent.  
>That's why in this repo you can find a folder with all our mockups and folders with our respective pages designs.

## Progression

The design is done for the 3 main pages, we are now working on the AJAX HTTPRequest.  
You can keep exact track of our work in the "Projects" part.  

## Details

We're all interns at [Becode](https://www.becode.org/) and started the development learning in early september.  
This project is an exercise to confirm our __HTML__ / __CSS__ / __Javascript__ skills, and introduce/continue the teaching of many skills :  
- Bootstrap
- Ajax, HTTP Requests and Responses
- Team management, the use of tools like Kanban
- Development work splitting
- Respecting customer demands
